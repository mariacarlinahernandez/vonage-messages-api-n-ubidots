# Keep track of your device's data in real-time with Vonage Messages API and Ubidots

I consider the **Internet of Things (IoT)** as a superhero: invisible. It makes our life better, at work, socially, and personally. Superheroes have the tremendous power to be there for you wherever you need them, whether it's in cities, hospitals, education institutions, manufacturing plants, farms, or any place you can have in mind. If you compare this to the Internet of Things it's very similar, don't you think?

Let's put ourselves in Natalia's shoes, Natalia works in the agricultural sector using [**Pig vision**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK_ReQbW1kg&feature=youtu.be) â€” an intelligent camera that integrates artificial intelligence and neural networks. With this device, she can get real-time metrics about the weighing process on the farms without the necessity of stressing the pigs. But what if Natalia needs to access the data but does not have internet access at that precise moment? Here's where the [**Vonage Messages API**](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/) comes in... What if Natalia requests the data she needs via SMS?

Nowadays, there are many messaging services and visualization platforms that make technology more accessible to everyone; we do not need to be expert engineers to create innovative solutions. In addition, these services allow you to deploy complete solutions in a matter of hours. Taking Natalia's use case as a reference as well as all the data based needs that can exist in the different industries, I thought it would be great to have a system capable of performing real-time monitoring of device data independent of the Internet access.

Fortunately, in this tutorial, I'm going to share detailed steps to build this system using the [**Vonage Messages API**](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/) as a messaging service and [**Ubidots**](https://ubidots.com/) as IoT Platform. As a starting point, let's understand the architecture to be implemented:

The integration of these services is made through the [UbiFunction](http://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2132086-analytics-ubifunctions-user-guide), a Serverless Computing Environment which will allow us to receive the message sent to the rented number over an HTTP request, to then analyze it to identify the devices and the variables requested, in order to send the last value received for each requested variables as a reply.

Undoubtedly, this system will be useful for different use cases. Just get a little bit creative to identify where it can be useful for the project you are working on. Without further ado, let's get started!

# Prerequisites

- [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up)
- [Ubidots account](https://industrial.ubidots.com/accounts/signup_industrial/)
- Any device with internet access

# Step-by-Step

1. IoT Platform Setup
   - Device setup
   - Dashboard setup
2. Vonage Setup
   - Application Setup
   - Rent number
3. Vonage & Ubidots Integration
4. Wrap Up & Next Steps

# 1. IoT Platform Setup

Ubidots allows rapid assembly and launch IoT applications without having to write many lines of code, it's simple yet powerful. To start using it, we only need [an account](https://industrial.ubidots.com/accounts/signup_industrial/), and any device with internet connection to transmit data to the [Ubidots API](https://ubidots.com/docs).

## Device Setup

For this project, I used a [Pycon SiPy](https://pycom.io/product/sipy/) + [PySense 1](https://pycom.io/product/pysense-2-0-x/) which allows us to monitor environmental variables from a single shield, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and pressure. However, if you have any other hardware that supports **HTTP**, **MQTT**, or **TCP/UDP** as a communication protocol it can be integrated as well. In this case, I recommend you to visit [Ubidots help center](https://help.ubidots.com/en/collections/356477-connect-your-devices), where you can find many tutorials on how to send and control data to/from the platform using any kind of IoT devices.

Pycom team is adding additional features every week on their products, so before start developing, make sure your board is running under the [last firmware update](https://docs.pycom.io/pytrackpysense/installation/firmware/). In addition, if you're using Windows as OS, you must [install the required drivers](https://docs.pycom.io/pytrackpysense/installation/drivers/).

**NOTE**: If this is your first time developing with Pycom boards, I highly recommend you check out the [getting started guide](https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/) to familiarize yourself with all the details.

1. Install the [Pymakr](), a plug-in available for [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/pymakr), and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr) to run and sync projects on any pycom board. Also, the Pymakr adds a REPL console to the terminal that connect to the board.

2. Establish the communication between Pymakr and your board, via Serial, or Telnet, as you preferred. Check out the setup guides based on your code editor:

- [Atom](https://docs.pycom.io/pymakr/installation/atom/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.pycom.io/pymakr/installation/vscode/)

### Coding

This project requires a couple of external libraries that must be downloaded and centralized in one place to work as it should, but don't worry, I already put all together (including the main code as well) in one place for you. It can be [download here](https://github.com/mariacarlinahernandez/pycom-boards/tree/master/examples/pysense-ubidots-mqtt), in case you're interested to see it all pull together.

1. Create a new project with the name of your preference. I decided to name it "**_pysense-ubidots-mqtt_**".

2. In the "**_pysense-ubidots-mqtt_**" project, we're going to manage the libraries required and the main code. To manage this, create a new folder called "**_lib_**", as well as a new file called "**_main.py_**"

3. From the [**pycom libraries repository**](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries), download the following libraries and place them into the "**_lib_**" folder just created.

- [PySense](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pysense/lib/pysense.py)
- [LTR329ALS01](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pysense/lib/LTR329ALS01.py)
- [MPL3115A2](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pysense/lib/MPL3115A2.py)
- [SI7006A20](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/pysense/lib/SI7006A20.py)
- [PyCoproc](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/blob/master/lib/pycoproc/pycoproc.py)
- [umqtt.simple](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/umqtt.simple)
- [umqtt.robuts](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/umqtt.robust)

After placing these libraries we must have the following structure into the project folder:

```
- lib
    - LTR329ALS01.py
    - MPL3115A2.py
    - pycoproc.py
    - pysense.py
    - SI7006A20.py
    - umqtt
        - robust.py
        - simple.py
- main.py
```

Basically these libraries allow us to communicate from the main board, in my case SiPy, with the PySense, and to manage the data with Ubidots over MQTT.

4. Copy the following code into the "main.py" file. This code constantly publishes temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude values to Ubidots.

```py

    if (time.time() - last_message) > message_interval:
      data = read_sensors()
      client.publish(b"/v1.6/devices/%s" % (ubidots_dev_label), data)
      last_message = time.time()

  except OSError as e:
    restart_and_reconnect()
```

But it is not just copy and paste, let's understand how the code works. First of all, the libraries required must be imported.

```py
from umqtt.robust import MQTTClient
import machine
import time
import pycom
import json
import ubinascii
from network import WLAN
from pysense import Pysense
from LIS2HH12 import LIS2HH12
from SI7006A20 import SI7006A20
from LTR329ALS01 import LTR329ALS01
from MPL3115A2 import MPL3115A2,ALTITUDE,PRESSURE
import gc
```

In the following variables, assign the network credentials to establish the connection:

```py
wifi_ssid = "xxxx"
wifi_password = "xxxx"
```

To establish the communication with an Ubidots account over MQTT, we have to define the broker address, as well as the client, and the username for communication authentication.

- **MQTT Broker**: `industrial.api.ubidots.com` or `169.55.61.243`.
- **MQTT Client**: unique identifier for the client-server communication. It is recommended to use the device's MAC address as identifier for the client since it's an unique value per device.
- **MQTT Username**: Authenticate the communcation with the broker. In case of Ubidots, we must assign the [account token](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/590078-find-your-token-from-your-ubidots-account) as username.

```py
mqtt_server = "industrial.api.ubidots.com" # 169.55.61.243
mqtt_clientID = ubinascii.hexlify(machine.unique_id(),'').decode()
mqtt_username = "BBFF-xxxx" # Set your Ubidots TOKEN
```

Next, assign the [device label](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/736670-how-to-adjust-the-device-name-and-variable-name). This label is the unique identifier that will allow us to communicate with Ubidots, either to publish or to subscribe data to/from a topic. It can be an string unique value, or the device's MAC address as well. In my case, I assigned `weather-station` as device label.

```py
ubidots_dev_label = "weather-station"
```

To finish with declartions, assign the data rate desired as `message_interval`; the variable has 5 seconds by defaul. The `last_message` variable will hold the last time a message was sent.

```py
last_message = 0
message_interval = 5
```

Now, it's time to connect the board to the local newtork. First, we must to create a `WLAN` network interface object. As you can see below, the object is created under the `wlan` variable, and is configured to used the external antenna - since I have the device deployed a little bit far away from the router. In case you desire to use the internal antenna, just use `wlan.antenna(WLAN.INT_ANT)`.

```py
wlan = WLAN(mode=WLAN.STA)
wlan.antenna(WLAN.EXT_ANT)
```

Then, the function `wifi_connect()` proceed to establish the communication with the network specified.

```py
wifi_connect(wifi_ssid, wifi_password)
```

But... What exactly is doing this function? Well, as you can see below, it takes on the task of establishing the network connection, and returns the network parameters only if the connection was established successfully. In case of a problem, it will be reported, and the device will be restarted to retry the connection.

```py
def wifi_connect(ssid, psw):
  attempts = 0

  print("Starting attempt to connect to WiFi.", end="")
  wlan.connect(ssid, auth=(WLAN.WPA2, psw), timeout=5000)

  while not wlan.isconnected():
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(".", end="")
    attempts += 1
    machine.idle()

    if attempts >= 10:
      print("\nssid: {}, psw: {}".format(wifi_ssid, wifi_password))
      print("\nCould not establish connection with the network provided. Please check the network crendentials or status, and try again.");
      time.sleep(0.5)
      attempts = 0
      machine.reset()

  network_settings =  wlan.ifconfig()
  print("\nWLAN connection succeeded!")
  print("IP address: {}".format(network_settings[0]))
  print("Subnet: {}".format(network_settings[1]))
  print("Gateway: {}".format(network_settings[2]))
  print("DNS: {}".format(network_settings[3]))

  return True

```

Then, initialize the PySense board as `py`

```py
py = Pysense()
```

To prevent communication problems with the broker, the connection will be established before entering the `while`. However, in case of any communication problem, the `umqtt` library will manage an automatic reconnection. In case the connection cannot be established for another reason, as the broker is down, the board will be restarted to try to establish the connection again.

```py
try:
  client = connect_mqtt()
except OSError as e:
  restart_and_reconnect()
```

The function `connect_mqtt()` open a new MQTT connection to the specified broker.

```py
def connect_mqtt():
  global mqtt_clientID, mqtt_server
  client = MQTTClient(mqtt_clientID, mqtt_server, user=mqtt_username, password=mqtt_username)
  client.connect()
  print("\nConnected to {} MQTT broker".format(mqtt_server))
  return client
```

To finish, as you can see below, the main code is actually in charge of 3 processes:

```py
while True:
  try:
    if wlan.isconnected() != True:
      wifi_connect(wifi_ssid, wifi_password)

    if (time.time() - last_message) > message_interval:
      data = read_sensors()
      client.publish(b"/v1.6/devices/%s" % (ubidots_dev_label), data)
      last_message = time.time()

  except OSError as e:
    restart_and_reconnect()
```

1. Checking the network connection:

```py
    if wlan.isconnected() != True:
      wifi_connect(wifi_ssid, wifi_password)
```

2. Publishing sensor data to Ubidots every 5 seconds.

```py
    if (time.time() - last_message) > message_interval:
      data = read_sensors()
      client.publish(b"/v1.6/devices/%s" % (ubidots_dev_label), data)
      last_message = time.time()
```

Where, the function `read_sensors()` is in charge of take all sensors readings, and build a JSON payload to be sent to Ubidots.

```py
def read_sensors():
  mpl_pressure = MPL3115A2(py, mode=PRESSURE)
  mpl_altitude = MPL3115A2(py,mode=ALTITUDE)
  si = SI7006A20(py)
  ltr = LTR329ALS01(py)

  pressure = mpl_pressure.pressure()
  altitude = mpl_altitude.altitude()
  temperature_mpl = mpl_altitude.temperature()
  temperature_si = si.temperature()
  relative_humidity = si.humidity()
  ambient_humidty = si.humid_ambient(temperature_si)
  dewpoint = si.dew_point()
  light = ltr.light()

  print("\nMPL3115A2 | Pressure: {} Pa, Altitude: {} m, Temperature: {} ÂºC".format(pressure, altitude, temperature_mpl))
  print("SI7006A20 | Temperature: {} ÂºC, Relative Humidity: {} %RH, Ambient Humidity: {} %RH, Dew point: {}".format(temperature_si, relative_humidity, ambient_humidty, dewpoint))
  print("LTR329ALS01 | Light (channel Blue lux, channel Red lux): {}\n".format(light))
  # JSON build
  data = b'{ "pressure" : %s,"altitude" : %s, "temp_mpl" : %s, "temp_si" : %s, "rel_hum" : %s, "amb_hum" : %s, "dew_point" : %s, "lux_blue" : %s, "lux_red" : %s }' % (pressure, altitude, temperature_mpl, temperature_si, relative_humidity, ambient_humidty, dewpoint, light[0], light[1])

  return data
```

3. Restarting the board in case an error with the broker occurs.

```py
  except OSError as e:
    restart_and_reconnect()
```

Where, the function `restart_and_reconnect()` restart the board to reconnect the connection with the broker.

```py
def restart_and_reconnect():
  print("\nFailed to connect to MQTT broker. Reconnecting...")
  time.sleep(10)
  machine.reset()
```

5. From the Pymakr, upload the code into the board by pressing the "**_Upload_**" button, and wait a couple of seconds until the device finishes its compilation.

6. From the Ubidots account, go to "**_Devices > Devices_**" section and see how a "**_weather-station_**" device was automatically created once the sensors data was received.

![Ubidots New Device](https://res.cloudinary.com/dv6imp5ps/image/upload/v1593280565/Articles/PyCom%20%2B%20Vonage%20%2B%20Ubidots/Ubidots%20New%20Device.png)

7. [OPTIONAL] Ubidots allow us to customize devices, and variables either with friendly names, colors, icons, descriptions, among other things. Just be aware that devices and variables label can not be changed since this label is the one that handles the communication between the devices and the platform.

In my case, I customized the variables' [names](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/736670-how-to-adjust-the-device-name-and-variable-name), [icons](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/904812-how-to-change-a-variable-s-description-icon), [units](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/1560178-dashboards-add-units-of-measure), and colors.

Before customization:

## Dashboard setup

One of the things I love when working using Ubidots is for their catchy and nice to the eye visualization they provide. Also, they have a wide variety of widgets that allow you to customize 100% how you want your dashboard to look. Dashboards are a very important part of IoT solutions, since we can access all the data of our devices from anywhere in the world, but... only if we have an internet connection.

1. To create the dashboard, navigate to the "**_Data > Dashboard_**" section. Then, click on "**_New Dashboard_**" and assign the desired name.

2. To add new widgets, just click on the blue plus icon, select the widget type, set a few visualization customizations and that's it. At this point, it's time to be creative and start exploring the different widgets that Ubidots offer.

See how my dashboard looks like!

![Ubidots Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dv6imp5ps/image/upload/v1593280563/Articles/PyCom%20%2B%20Vonage%20%2B%20Ubidots/Ubidots%20Dashboard.png)

To get depth on dashboards and widget settings, I highly recommend you check out the following guides:

- [Create Dashboards and Widgets](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2400308-create-dashboards-and-widgets)
- [Application Branding: Custom styles for your dashboards and widgets](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/3189001-application-branding-custom-styles-for-your-dashboards-and-widgets)

# 2. Vonage Setup

Thanks to the [Vonage Messages API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/) we can enable different messaging strategies in a simple way. In addition, it is important to highlight that not only does it allow us to send [SMS](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/), it also allows communication through different channels including [MMS](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/features/mms/), [Whatsapp](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/features/whatsapp/), [Facebook Messenger](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/features/facebook-messenger/), and [Viber](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/features/viber/). However, to fulfill the purpose of this guide, I'll use the SMS channel, as I want to demonstrate how to request data in case you don't have internet access.

Let's look at the steps below to set up our Vonage account:

1. Access your Vonage account. If you don't have one already, [sign up](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) and start building today.

2. Once signed in, we'll find the [**API Key & API Secret**](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/authentication#api-key-and-secret) of your account at the top side of the [Vonage API Dasboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/). These credentials are required when establishing communication from external services such as Ubidots; be aware that these credentials should always be kept secure and never shared.

3. Create a [**new application**](https://developer.nexmo.com/application/overview). You can do this by using the Vonage API Dashboard, just go to **"Your applications > + Create a new application"** and assign a name for it, or by [**sending an HTTP request**](https://developer.nexmo.com/application/code-snippets/create-application). In order to make this guide user-friendly, I decided to do it straight from the dashboard. You just need to handle a few clicks, assign a name and that's it!

4. To receive inbound messages, we must rent a [Nexmo virtual number](https://developer.nexmo.com/numbers/overview). The number can be rented using the [developer dashboard](https://developer.nexmo.com/numbers/guides/number-management), [Nexmo CLI](https://developer.nexmo.com/numbers/guides/numbers-cli), or via [API](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/numbers).

5. Link the rented number to the application previously created by clicking on the "**_link_**" button in the application's number section.

![Nexmo Virtual Number](https://res.cloudinary.com/dv6imp5ps/image/upload/v1593389704/Articles/PyCom%20%2B%20Vonage%20%2B%20Ubidots/Nexmo%20Virtual%20Number.png)

# 3. Vonage & Ubidots Integration

1. On the Ubidots account, go to the "**_Device >Functions_**" section, and click the plus icon located at the top right side of the site to create a new function. To create the function you must assign the following parameters:

- **Name**: `Vonage Messages API`
- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Runtime**: `NodeJs 10`

**NOTE**: The UbiFunction can also be programmed in Python, in case you are a Python lover. But the code provided in this guide is in NodeJS

Once configured, press the "**_Make it live_**" button. At this point, we'll see the "**_HTTPS Endpoint URL_**" field auto-complete with the endpoint that will receive the messages from Vonage.

In my case, the generated URL was: `https://parse.ubidots.com/prv/{ubidots_username}/vonage-messages-api`

2.  On the Vonage Developer Portal, navigate to the "**_Settings_**" section clicking on your username, then assign the following paramenters under the "**_Default SMS Setting_**" option. To finish, save the changes.".

- **Delivery receipts**: HTTPS Endpoint URL generated + `/webhooks/delivery-receipts`

> `https://parse.ubidots.com/prv/{ubidots_username}/vonage-messages-api/webhooks/delivery-receipts`

- **Inbound messages**: HTTPS Endpoint URL generated + `/webhooks/inbound-message`

> `https://parse.ubidots.com/prv/{ubidots_username}/vonage-messages-api/webhooks/inbound-message`

- **HTTP Method**: `POST`

When a message is sent to the virtual number, it will forward the information to this endpoint.

3. Go back to the UbiFunction created, and replace the default code with the code below.

```js
// Import the 'request-promise' library to handle HTTP requests
var request = require("request-promise");

// Ubidots constants
const UBIDOTS_TOKEN = "BBFF-xxxx";
// Vonage constants
const VONAGE_API_SECRET = "xxxxxx";

/*
 * Main function - runs every time the UbiFunction is executed
 *
 * @arg args, dictionary containing Vonage request data
 */
async function main(args) {
  // When sending SMS, delivery receipts will be returned
  // status: submitted, delivered,
  if (args["status"]) {
    return args;
  }

  // Parses incoming values
  var api_key = args["api-key"];
  var keyword = args["keyword"];
  var msisdn = args["msisdn"];
  var text = args["text"];
  var to = args["to"];
  var msg_type = args["type"];
  //var message_timestamp = args['message-timestamp'];
  //var messageId = args['messageId'];

  // Verify the keyword received to request the data
  if (keyword == "UBIDOTS") {
    text = text.toLowerCase(); // Converts the text received to lowercase letters

    // Filter the requested devices
    const devices = /Devices:(.*)/i.exec(text);
    const deviceList = devices[1].split(",").map((device) => device.trim());
    // Filter the requested variables
    const variables = /Variables:(.*)/i.exec(text);
    const variableList = variables[1]
      .split(",")
      .map((variable) => variable.trim());

    // "msg" stores the response to be sent
    var msg = "Data requested:\n";

    // Iterates the deviceList previously filtered
    for (const device of deviceList) {
      msg = msg.concat("\nDevice: ", device);
      // Iterates the variableList previously filtered
      for (const variable of variableList) {
        // Handle GET request to Ubidots
        try {
          var response = await ubidots_get_request(
            UBIDOTS_TOKEN,
            device,
            variable
          );
          msg = msg.concat("\nVariable: ", variable, " = ", response);
        } catch (error) {
          // Send a reply back in case any error is presented
          var vonage_response = await vonage_messages(

            "The requested data cannot be found. Please verify it and try again."
          );
          // Pass the error message caught as the function's response
          return { message: error.message };
        }
      }
      msg = msg.concat("\n");
    }
  }

  // Send a reply back with the requested data
  /*  Reply example for multiple devices and variables:

  //var vonage_response = await vonage_messages(api_key, msg_type, msisdn, to, msg);
  var vonage_response = await vonage_messages(
    api_key,

      "X-Auth-Token": token,

  };

  var response = await request.post(options);

  return response;
}
```

Then, we must replace the `UBIDOTS_TOKEN` constant with the [Ubidots TOKEN](http://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/590078-find-your-token-from-your-ubidots-account), and the `VONAGE_API_SECRET` with the [Vonage API Secret](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/authentication#api-key-and-secret) to allow the communication between the UbiFunction and both services.

```js
// Ubidots constants
const UBIDOTS_TOKEN = "BBFF-xxxx";
// Vonage constants
const VONAGE_API_SECRET = "xxxxxx";
```

Don't forget to press the "**_Make it live_**" button to save the changes made!

4. The code provided is detailed commented on each of its processes and functions, so understanding it should not be too difficult. However, let's highlight how it works:

- The UbiFunction main code is in charge of receiving as argument the payload sent by Vonage when a new SMS is sent, or when some other SMS' status is reported.
- Then, the received SMS is analyzed to identify the API key, keyword, received SMS, and the sender.
- If the keyword received is equal to Ubidots, the text received will be filtered to create a list of the devices and variables to be requested.
- The lists created are iterated to request the last value of each of the variables to Ubidots.
- The requested data is concatenated into a string, which is sent as a reply to the sender once all the data has been correctly requested.

5. Now, for the request of data to be done satisfactorily via SMS, we must follow the following templates:

- **For a single device**:

**SMS Request**:

```
Ubidots request data
Devices: {device_label}
Variables: {variable_label_1}, {variable_label_2}, {variable_label_n}
```

**SMS Reply**:

```
Data requested:

Device: {device_label}
Variable: {variable_label_1} = 23
Variable: {variable_label_2} = 246
Variable: {variable_label_n} = 85
```

- **For mutiple devices**:

**SMS Request**:

```
Ubidots request data
Devices: {device_label_1}, {device_label_2}, {device_label_n}
Variables: {variable_label_1}, {variable_label_2}, {variable_label_n}
```

**SMS Reply**:

```
Data requested:

Device: {device_label_1}
Variable: {variable_label_1} = 23
Variable: {variable_label_2} = 246
Variable: {variable_label_n} = 85

Device: {device_label_2}
Variable: {variable_label_1} = 23
Variable: {variable_label_2} = 246
Variable: {variable_label_n} = 85

Device: {device_label_n}
Variable: {variable_label_1} = 23
Variable: {variable_label_2} = 246
Variable: {variable_label_n} = 85
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Multiple device requests will be supported only for devices containing the same variables.

To check that everything is working as it should, let's send two messages to the rented numner, one with the device created (`weather-station`), and another with a device that does not exist to differentiate the replies:

**Request #1**:

```
Ubidots request data
Devices: weather-station
Variables: dew_point, lux_blue, amb_hum, temp_mpl
```

**Request #2**:

```
Ubidots request data
Devices: ws
Variables: dew_point, lux_blue, amb_hum, temp_mpl
```

The replies received were:

| Satisfactory reply                                                                                                                                                                     | Device not found                                                                                                                                                                 |

As expected, it works correctly! Now if we compare the received values with the values of our dashboard we can see that they are the same.

## 4. Wrap Up & Next Steps

When we talk about the Internet of Things, the first thing that comes to our mind is "Internet", but the reality is that there are other alternatives that allow us to have access to that data even if we do not have access to the Internet at some point.

In this guide, we have covered everything you need to know to communicate the Vonage Messages API with Ubidots to request data via an SMS. However, you can expand this development and customize it to any IoT application you can have in mind, whether it's a home light control application, community networks for sensors, custom chatbots, and more.

In addition, you can explore the other channels offered by the [Vonage Messages API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/messages/), I'm quite sure that with it, you can start working on your next superhero. :)
